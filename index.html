            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My mission is to live a disciplined life grounded in faith and continual growth, where I prioritize
                prayer, reflection, and daily commitments (e.g., writing down goals, reading books, journaling) to
                sharpen both my character and my skills. Through humility, hard work, and creativity, I seek to honor my
                family and contribute lasting innovations in game development and software that inspire people and
                meaningfully shape the world.</p>
